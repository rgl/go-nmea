This is a [NMEA 0183](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMEA_0183) parser.

This was tested with the [Adafruit Ultimate GPS Breakout Version 3](http://www.adafruit.com/products/746) module. 

The supported NMEA sentences were extracted from the [GlobalTop PMTK command packet datasheet](http://www.adafruit.com/datasheets/PMTK_A11.pdf).

## Example

See the `visitor` type implementation in the unit tests.
